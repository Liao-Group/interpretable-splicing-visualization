   In case you have installed the <strong>Perl</strong> or <strong>Python</strong>
   bindings for RNAlib, you might want to adjust your <em>PERL5LIB</em> and/or
   <em>PYTHONPATH</em>, respectively. You can do this by adding the following
   lines to your <em>~/.bash_profile<em>, or <em>~/.bashrc</em>, e.g.:
  </p>
<pre>
export PERL5LIB=/usr/local/Library/Perl/5.18:${PERL5LIB}
</pre>
  <br>
  <p>and/or</p>
<pre>
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}
</pre>
